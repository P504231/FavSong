Dil ibadat kar raha hai Dhadkanein meri sun
Tujh ko main kar loon haasil lagi hai yehi dhun
Zindagi ki shaakh se loon kuch haseen pal main chun
Tujh ko main kar loon haasil lagi hai yehi dhun

My heart is praying, listen to my heartbeats
I should get you, only that's what I want
From the branches of life I should pick some beautiful moments
I should get you, only that's what I want

Jo bhi jitne pal jiyun Unhe tere sang jiyun
Jo bhi kal ho ab mera Usse tere sang jiyun
Jo bhi saansein main bharun Unhe tere sang bharoon
Chahe jo ho raasta Usse tere sang chaloon

Whatever moments I live, I should live them with you
Whatever is my tomorrow now, I should live it with you
Whatever breaths I take, I should take them with you
Whatever be the path now, I should walk it with you.

Mujhko de tu mitt jaane ab se khud dil mil jaane
Kyun hai yeh itna faasla
Lamhe ye phir na aane Inko tu na de jaane
Tu mujhpe khudko de lutaa
Tujhe tujh se tod loon Kahin khud se jod loon
Mere jismo jaan mein aa Teri khushboo odh loon
Jo bhi saansein...

You let me end, let my heart merge into you
Why is there so much distance
These moments won't come again, don't let them go
You sacrifice yourself onto me
I should pluck you from yourself, add to myself somewhere
Come to my body and soul, I should cover myself with your scent
whatever breaths...

Bahaon mein de bas jaane, Seene mein de chhup jaane
Tujh bin main jaaun to kahan
Tujh se hai mujhko paane, Yaadon ke woh nazraane
Ik jinpe hak ho bas mera
Teri yaadon mein rahun Tere khwabon mein jagun
Mujhe doondhe jab koi Teri aankhon mein milun
Jo bhi saansein main...

Let me live in your arms, Let me hide in your chest,
Where else can I go except you,
From you only I have to get those gifts of memories
that are only mine.
I should live in your memories, I should wake in your dreams,
When someone looks for me, I should be found in your eyes..
Whatever breaths I..

(In this entire song, where I use 'I should', it actually goes like 'I feel like doing' which I have tried to shorten for ease)
