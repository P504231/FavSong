Behti hawa sa tha woh
Udhti patang sa tha woh
Kahan gaya usse dhoondo
Behti hawa sa tha woh
Udhti patang sa tha woh
Kahan gaya usse dhoondo
Hum ko toh raahein thi chalati
Woh khud apni raah banata
Girta, sambhalta
Masti mein chalta tha woh
Hum ko kal ki fikr satati
Woh bas aaj ka jashn manata
Har lamhe ko khul ke jeeta tha woh
Kahan se aaya tha woh
Chhu ke hamare dil ko
Kahan gaya usse dhoondo
Sulagti dhoop mein chaon ke jaisa
Reghistan mein gaon ke jaisa
Mann ke ghaav pe marham jaisa tha woh
Hum sehme se rehte kuve mein
Woh nadiya mein gotae lagata
Ulti dhara cheer ke tairta tha woh
Baadal awara tha woh
Yaar hamara tha woh
Kahan gaya usse dhoondo
Hum ko toh raahein thi chalati
Woh khud apni raah banata
Girta, sambhalta
Masti mein chalta tha woh
Hum ko kal ki fikr satati
Woh bas aaj ka jashn manata
Har lamhe ko khul ke jeeta tha woh
Kahan se aaya tha woh
Chhu ke hamare dil ko
Kahan gaya usse dhoondo

3 Idiots â€“ Behti Hawa Sa Tha Woh Lyrics English Translation
Behti hawa sa tha woh
He was like a flowing breeze
Udhti patang sa tha woh
He was like a flying kite
Kahan gaya usse dhoondo
Where has he gone, search for him
Behti hawa sa tha woh
He was like a flowing breeze
Udhti patang sa tha woh
He was like a flying kite
Kahan gaya usse dhoondo
Where has he gone, search for him
Hum ko toh raahein thi chalati
While the paths always lead us
Woh khud apni raah banata
He always made his own paths
Girta, sambhalta
Falling and getting up
Masti mein chalta tha woh
He used to walk around with joy
Hum ko kal ki fikr satati
We used to be worried about tomorrow
Woh bas aaj ka jashn manata
He used to only enjoy today
Har lamhe ko khul ke jeeta tha woh
He used to live every moment fully
Kahan se aaya tha woh
From where did he come
Chhu ke hamare dil ko
He touched our hearts
Kahan gaya usse dhoondo
Where has he gone, search for him
Sulagti dhoop mein chaon ke jaisa
He was like a shade in the burning sun
Reghistan mein gaon ke jaisa
He was like a village in the desert
Mann ke ghaav pe marham jaisa tha woh
He was like an ointment on the wound of the heart
Hum sehme se rehte kuve mein
We used to fear in a well
Woh nadiya mein gotae lagata
While he used to dive in the rivers
Ulti dhara cheer ke tairta tha woh
He used to swim against the current
Baadal awara tha woh
He was a wandering cloud
Yaar hamara tha woh
He was our close friend
Kahan gaya usse dhoondo
Where has he gone, search for him
Hum ko toh raahein thi chalati
While the paths always lead us
Woh khud apni raah banata
He always made his own paths
Girta, sambhalta
Falling and getting up
Masti mein chalta tha woh
He used to walk around with joy
Hum ko kal ki fikr satati
We used to be worried about tomorrow
Woh bas aaj ka jashn manata
He used to only enjoy today
Har lamhe ko khul ke jeeta tha woh
He used to live every moment fully
Kahan se aaya tha woh
From where did he come
Chhu ke hamare dil ko
He touched our hearts
Kahan gaya usse dhoondo
Where has he gone, search for him
